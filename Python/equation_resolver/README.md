## Code Explanation

### Key Concepts

#### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- **Abstraction:** The `Equation` class is an abstract base class (ABC) that enforces a consistent structure for subclasses.
- **Encapsulation:** Subclasses like `LinearEquation` and `QuadraticEquation` manage coefficients and behaviors specific to their type.
- **Inheritance:** Subclasses inherit and extend the behavior of the `Equation` class.

#### Type Enforcement
- Input validation ensures coefficients are numeric and of appropriate types.
- Attributes like `degree` and `type` must be defined in subclasses.

#### Methods
- `__str__`: Represents equations as strings in mathematical form.
- `solve`: Computes solutions for specific equation types.
- `analyze`: Provides additional insights (e.g., slope for linear equations, vertex details for quadratic equations).

### Flow

1. **Abstract Class Definition**
   - `Equation` serves as the blueprint for all equation types with attributes (`degree`, `type`) and methods (`solve`, `analyze`).

2. **Subclass Implementation**
   - `LinearEquation` handles first-degree equations.
   - `QuadraticEquation` manages second-degree equations and calculates the discriminant (`delta`).

3. **Equation Solver**
   - The `solver()` function takes an equation object, validates its type, and:
     - Generates solutions using the `solve` method.
     - Produces a detailed report including solutions and equation-specific details (e.g., concavity or slope).

4. **Execution**
   - Create instances of `LinearEquation` or `QuadraticEquation`.
   - Pass them to `solver()` for a comprehensive analysis and output.
