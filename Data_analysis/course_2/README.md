### Jupyter Notebooks Tutorial

This is a quick tutorial about Jupyter Notebooks. To open it, we recommend you to use Google Colab. You'll need a free Google account to do so.

Once you have your account, go to [https://colab.research.google.com/](https://colab.research.google.com/) and follow these steps:

1. Select **Github** on the left side selector (other options include Recent, Google Drive, Upload). Choose **Github**.
2. On the text input that says Github URL put the URL of this repo: `https://github.com/rmotr-curriculum/ds-content-interactive-jupyterlab-tutorial`.
3. Wait a few seconds and you'll see two Notebooks being populated in the screen.
4. Click on the Notebook name `Tutorial.ipynb` to open it.
